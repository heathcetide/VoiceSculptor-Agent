# RustPBX - AI-Powered Software-Defined PBX

RustPBX is a high-performance, secure software-defined PBX (Private Branch Exchange) system implemented in Rust, designed to support AI-powered communication pipelines and modern voice applications.

## üöÄ Key Features

### SIP PBX Core
- **Full SIP Stack**: Complete SIP proxy server with registration, authentication, and call routing
- **Media Proxy**: Advanced RTP/RTCP media proxying with NAT traversal support
- **Multi-Transport**: UDP, TCP, and WebSocket transport support
- **Call Recording**: Built-in call recording with multiple storage backends
- **User Management**: Flexible user authentication and registration system

### AI Voice Agent Services
- **Speech-to-Text (ASR)**: Real-time speech recognition with multiple providers (Tencent Cloud, VoiceAPI)
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: High-quality speech synthesis with emotion and speaker control
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI-compatible LLM proxy for intelligent conversation handling
- **Voice Activity Detection**: WebRTC and Silero VAD support for optimal speech processing
- **Noise Suppression**: Real-time audio denoising for crystal-clear conversations

### WebRTC Integration
- **Direct WebRTC Calls**: Native WebRTC support for web-based communications
- **STUN/TURN Support**: Built-in ICE server management for NAT traversal
- **Codec Support**: Multiple audio codecs (PCMU, PCMA, G.722, PCM)
- **Real-time Media**: Low-latency audio streaming and processing

### RESTful API & WebSocket
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Complete REST API for call management and control
- **WebSocket Commands**: Real-time call control via WebSocket connections
- **Call Management**: List, monitor, and control active calls
- **LLM Proxy**: Built-in proxy for AI language model services

## üìä Architecture

### SIP Workflow
![Sip](./docs/sip.png)

The SIP workflow demonstrates how external applications can initiate calls through RustPBX, leveraging the full SIP protocol stack for reliable voice communications.

### WebRTC Workflow
![Webrtc](./docs/webrtc.png)

The WebRTC workflow shows how web applications can establish direct peer-to-peer connections via RustPBX, enabling modern browser-based voice applications.

## üõ† Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.75 or later
- Cargo package manager

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/restsend/rustpbx
